                    <p>My favoirte animal is cat. Cats are smart and sensitive. They feel the world around them and have their own big world inside their heart. They are completely sinking in their own thoughts without caring whatever is going on outside. Sometimes you'll see a cat sitting silently on the mat, beside a window or on a couch, when suddenly jumps up and starts looking around. I hope some day in the futuer, I'll be able to raise a lovely kitten as a pet, care him and play with him like he's my little mate. I want to see him grow healthly and live happily with my family.</p>
